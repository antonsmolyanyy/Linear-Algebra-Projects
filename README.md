# Linear Algebra for Machine Learning
A collection of projects implementing various linear algebra techniques, with applications in computing and machine learning.
While many of the techniques I implemented are already existing numpy functions, they serve as an exercise to develop my knowledge of linear algebra and developing algorithms. 

I am Anton Smolyanyy, a Data Science and Applied Math undergraduate at the University of Utah Honors College. These projects are inspired by 
the early stages of my work with Professor Akil Narayan at the U of U's Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute.
